# Test Instructions
The code in this directory contains a skeleton console application. You must
write enough code to achieve the following requirements:

1) Given a properly formatted xml or json file, print (console) the data in the
   specified output format (xml|json). The data is a collection of Addresses. 
   There can be 0 or more Addresses in the collection.

2) The console output should contain line breaks and indentation for readability.

3) Although this test is limited to json and xml formats, the application should
   be easily extended to allow other formats (csv, yaml, etc).
   
4) The application is run using these commands:
   php console.php data-convert sample-data/data.xml -o json
   php console.php data-convert sample-data/data.json -o xml

## Prerequisites
You must have an internet connected computer with the Docker application installed.

## Set up the environment
The steps below will allow you to create the docker container which can be used 
to execute this code. Run these commands from this project's root directory.

Replace the "/full/path/to" with your actual full path to the project's root directory
docker build -t php-data-test .
docker run -v /full/path/to/PHPDataTest:/var/www/html -d php-data-test

## Log into the container in order to run commands
docker ps (get container id)
docker exec -it $containerId bash

## Install the vendor libraries (inside the docker container)
php composer.phar install
